I am a Research Fellow in the [MRC Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/zulma.cucunuba) in the UK. I also hold an academic appointment as Assistant Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Colombia  [Department of Clinical Epidemiology.


My research focuses on using statistic and mathematical methods to understand the determinants of the spread of infection diseases and the impact of control strategies, with a particular focus in Latin America. 

I have mainly worked on vector bone diseases including Chagas disease, Zika, Chikungunya and Malaria. More recently I have been working on emerging infections, epidemic response and vaccine preventable diseases.

My background includes Medicine and Public Health and a PhD on Infectious Disease Epidemiology. I did a postdoc with the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (2017). I was awarded the MRC Rutherford Fund Fellowship 2017-2020.


I am an avid R enthusiast for epidemic analytics and a member of the [R Epidemics Consortium (RECON)](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/people/).
